# [DrySel](https://github.com/orion-analytics/drysel)
“Automate the (Test) Automation”. “DrySel” is a family of test automation frameworks and tools, developed based on the fundamental software engineering principle “Don’t Repeat Yourself”. It aims to eliminate writing "Selenium/WebDriver" specific code, or even further, it aims to eleminate writing any "programming" code from UI Test Automation.

## DrySelJSON
"DrySelJSON" framework is built on top of the [“DrySelCore”](https://github.com/orion-analytics/dryselcore). It pushes out definitions of the Test Objects (reprenting UI and Test Data) from the programming boundaries of the “Core”, making it possible for programmers as well as non-programmers to contribute in defining “Test Objects” in easy to understand “JSON” objects.
