# DrySel
“Automate the (Test) Automation”. “DrySel” is a family of test automation frameworks and tools, developed based on the fundamental software engineering principle “Don’t Repeat Yourself”. It aims to eliminate writing "Selenium/WebDriver" specific code, or even further, it aims to eleminate writing any "programming" code from UI Test Automation.

## DrySelJSON
"DrySelJSON" framework is built on top of the “DrySelCore”. It pushes out definitions of the Test Objects (reprenting UI and Test Data) from the programming boundaries of the “Core”, making it possible for programmers as well as non-programmers to contribute in defining “Test Objects” in easy to understand “JSON” objects.
